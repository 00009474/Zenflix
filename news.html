            Viewers found in a fresh episode of "The Mandalorian" a blooper twin of a glass of coffee from "Game of Thrones"
        </h1>
        <p class="news-post-text">
            One of the most discussed topics after the premiere of the fourth episode of the second season of "The Mandalorian", 
            along with the traditional discussions of numerous Easter eggs, became a mistake that confused some especially keen viewers.
             He was immediately named the twin brother of the coffee glass from the last season of Game of Thrones. 
             True, if we take into account the abundance of movie bloopers in the entire history of TV series and cinema, 
             there will certainly be much more successful comparisons.

                HBO approves filming of the full first season of the film adaptation of The Last of Us
            </h1>
            <p class="news-post-text-2">
                Last spring, HBO launched the film adaptation of Naughty Dog's hit hit The Last of Us, 
                which brought the world to its cult series Uncharted.
             Since then, screenwriter Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and creative director of the original source Neil Druckmann have worked on the project. 
             And today we can say with confidence that their work was crowned with success: having familiarized with their creative work, 
             the channel gave the go-ahead for the filming of the full first season.
